# Repertoire Backend

This is the backend of the application, which is written completely in Go using the Gin Gonic Framework.

## Prerequisites

### Go

...

### Docker

...

## Get Started

#### Restore dependencies

#### Build

...

#### Run

...

## Live Reload

In order to use live reload in the application, simply install *Air* on your system, by using the following command:

```sh
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```

Next, simply use the following command to build and run the application and start the live reloading:

```sh
air
```

The above command will look in the directory for a `.air.toml` file for configuration, 
but that's already included in the application.
